# Write the Docs NA 2016 - Day One

## [What Writing Fiction Teaches You About Writing Documentation](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-thursday-bram)

Speaker: [Thursday Bram](https://twitter.com/thursdayb)

Fiction books are popular. Everyone, even tech writers, read fiction, not documentation, for fun. [Elmore Leonard's rules for writing fiction](https://www.writingclasses.com/toolbox/tips-masters/elmore-leonard-10-rules-for-good-writing) can apply to documentation as well, if they're modified a bit.

1. Never start a piece of documentation with a general description of your immunity or ecosystem.
2. Avoid starting with *anything* that isn't relevant.
3. Keep verbs simple and actionable.
4.



### Understand Your Audience

It's important for any type of writing. As John Steinbeck said, "your audience is one single reader." Imagine this one person as you write.

Thursday discussed *The Last Colony* and *Zoe's Tale* by John Scalzi. They both tell the same story, but from different perspectives.

### Write What You Know

This can be problematic because we don't always know what we're writing about. We do know our own experience. Making the writing more personal and accessible is always good. Keep a close eye on the words people talk about your product and use them. There are some words and phrases that make writing sound like an opinion, such as, "of course," "always," and others. Avoid those.

### Be Brief

Be Hemingway, not Dickens.

### Emotion Matters

You don't want to create the emotion of anger in readers of your documentation. You want to try to elicit positive feelings. In fiction, emotion is controlled by rising and falling actions. *A Christmas Carol* is a superlative example of this. In documentation, there are usually no climaxes or conclusions. Just completing the steps is often not enough to create a feeling of satisfaction in the reader/user. Some examples of how to create this in documentation is a "next steps" section that suggests how the user can apply what they just learned to something else.

### Kill your Darlings

Cleverness is rarely clear. In documentation, clarity is important. There is no room for cleverness.

### Provide Context

Context is important. It's why shows have recaps at the beginning of new seasons and episodes. George R.R. Martin doesn't provide a lot of context in his books. The show does, even with the opening credits. In documentation, context is important because it's often as complicated as GoT. Hyperlinks help provide context.

### Set a Reading Order

You should be cognizant of the order in which your audience will read your writing. Robin McKinley has two books, *The Blue Sword* and *The Hero and the Crown* and you need to read them in the correct order because *TBS* was written first. As a writer, you want to suggest a reading order, as Robin McKinley did. But users might have good ideas for other orders for other use cases, and this can be good.

### Maintain the Canon

In documentation, the canon is the core docs. In Harry Potter, the books are canon. But it's important to keep this updated and not let it rot.

### Encourage Fan Fiction

Getting your user community to create tutorials and such can be valuable. To do this, it's important to give them tools and guidelines for contributing.

### Beta Readers and Workshops

Fan fiction communities use a system of "beta readers" instead of editors. This is a transparent system that plays out in full view of the community. For docs, this can translate to an early beta version of the docs.

### Reading and Writing are Connected Habits

Read as widely as possible. Read everything. Even disconnected things might inspire your doc writing. Or other types of writing. Thursday has a "swipe file" that's full of snippets of good writing from myriad sources. She uses Evernote for this.

### Recomended Reads

- *Sin and Syntax* by Constance Hale

- *Bird by Bird* by Anne Lamott

- *The Seven Basic Plots* by Christopher Booker

- *On Writing* by Stephen King


## [7 Values of Effective Technical Writing Teams](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-joao-fernandes)

Speaker: [Joao Fernandes](https://twitter.com/joaofnfernandes)

Joao is a skeptic and doesn't believe in the "7 habits" kind of trope.

Tech writing is explaining complex information in a clear way. That may have been true, but users now don't expect to have to read docs to use apps and other product. So, the mission of tech writers now is to help build products that need no documentation. You should help the team build productsthat

### Be the CEO of the Docs

#### Create a Vision

Provide a vision to the users. Add buttons, labels, tooltips and other hints that gently guide the user in the right direction. Provide in-app help and carefully think about what and where to document. You also have to decide what not to document. Define the information architecture of the docs.

#### Pitch the Vision

Inform other teams about what the vision is.

#### Drive the Vision

Schedule time do do strategic work to make sure that the vision is implemented.

#### Ensure Others Follow the Vision

You'll always be outnumbered by the rest of the company. This means that sometimes you have to push back and say no to others. If you don't you end

### Know the Market

You can't only know your audience anymore. You have to know the market to udnerstand what "pain points" your company is trying to solve. You also have to know the product and the users to be able to determine what to document, e.g. whether something is worth documenting at all. If you don't, you won't be able to pitch your vision.

### Ask Why

People tell tech writers what to do all the time. Tech writers rarely ask why. They should. If you don't, you can't prioritize, share your roadmap, and you won't have any time for strategic work. And you might end up fooling yourself.

### Perfection Takes Time

Create, ship, iterate. Apply the 80/20 rule.

### Be Proactive

It's easy not to be proactive. There are a lot of excuses: no time, no resources, management won't let you, people ignore you, that's not your job description, and so on. Designers faced this same problem. But they adapted and now they have more influence and budget and are involved early and intensely in projects.

### Treat Words as Tools

A programming language is a tool. Natural languages are also tools. The latter are deeply imperfect tools. Language is often insufficient to convey the required information. As with JavaScript, you can modify natural language. If you're too tied to style guides and best practices, you might be doing art.

### Share Knowledge

Instead of complaining about the poor writing of others, effective tech writers empower others to write and make changes. You can do this through blog posts, style guides, and one-on-one sessions.
