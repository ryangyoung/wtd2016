Fiction books are popular. Everyone, even tech writers, read fiction, not documentation, for fun. [Elmore Leonard's rules for writing fiction](https://www.writingclasses.com/toolbox/tips-masters/elmore-leonard-10-rules-for-good-writing) can apply to documentation as well, if they're modified a bit.

1. Never start a piece of documentation with a general description of your immunity or ecosystem.
2. Avoid starting with *anything* that isn't relevant.
3. Keep verbs simple and actionable.
4.



### Understand Your Audience

It's important for any type of writing. As John Steinbeck said, "your audience is one single reader." Imagine this one person as you write.

Thursday discussed *The Last Colony* and *Zoe's Tale* by John Scalzi. They both tell the same story, but from different perspectives.

### Write What You Know

This can be problematic because we don't always know what we're writing about. We do know our own experience. Making the writing more personal and accessible is always good. Keep a close eye on the words people talk about your product and use them. There are some words and phrases that make writing sound like an opinion, such as, "of course," "always," and others. Avoid those.

### Be Brief

Be Hemingway, not Dickens.

### Emotion Matters

You don't want to create the emotion of anger in readers of your documentation. You want to try to elicit positive feelings. In fiction, emotion is controlled by rising and falling actions. *A Christmas Carol* is a superlative example of this. In documentation, there are usually no climaxes or conclusions. Just completing the steps is often not enough to create a feeling of satisfaction in the reader/user. Some examples of how to create this in documentation is a "next steps" section that suggests how the user can apply what they just learned to something else.

### Kill your Darlings

Cleverness is rarely clear. In documentation, clarity is important. There is no room for cleverness.

### Provide Context

Context is important. It's why shows have recaps at the beginning of new seasons and episodes. George R.R. Martin doesn't provide a lot of context in his books. The show does, even with the opening credits. In documentation, context is important because it's often as complicated as GoT. Hyperlinks help provide context.

### Set a Reading Order

You should be cognizant of the order in which your audience will read your writing. Robin McKinley has two books, *The Blue Sword* and *The Hero and the Crown* and you need to read them in the correct order because *TBS* was written first. As a writer, you want to suggest a reading order, as Robin McKinley did. But users might have good ideas for other orders for other use cases, and this can be good.

### Maintain the Canon

In documentation, the canon is the core docs. In Harry Potter, the books are canon. But it's important to keep this updated and not let it rot.

### Encourage Fan Fiction

Getting your user community to create tutorials and such can be valuable. To do this, it's important to give them tools and guidelines for contributing.

### Beta Readers and Workshops

Fan fiction communities use a system of "beta readers" instead of editors. This is a transparent system that plays out in full view of the community. For docs, this can translate to an early beta version of the docs.

### Reading and Writing are Connected Habits

Read as widely as possible. Read everything. Even disconnected things might inspire your doc writing. Or other types of writing. Thursday has a "swipe file" that's full of snippets of good writing from myriad sources. She uses Evernote for this.

### Recomended Reads

- *Sin and Syntax* by Constance Hale

- *Bird by Bird* by Anne Lamott

- *The Seven Basic Plots* by Christopher Booker

- *On Writing* by Stephen King


## [7 Values of Effective Technical Writing Teams](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-joao-fernandes)

Speaker: [Joao Fernandes](https://twitter.com/joaofnfernandes)

Joao is a skeptic and doesn't believe in the "7 habits" kind of trope.

Tech writing is explaining complex information in a clear way. That may have been true, but users now don't expect to have to read docs to use apps and other product. So, the mission of tech writers now is to help build products that need no documentation. You should help the team build productsthat

### Be the CEO of the Docs

#### Create a Vision

Provide a vision to the users. Add buttons, labels, tooltips and other hints that gently guide the user in the right direction. Provide in-app help and carefully think about what and where to document. You also have to decide what not to document. Define the information architecture of the docs.

#### Pitch the Vision

Inform other teams about what the vision is.

#### Drive the Vision

Schedule time do do strategic work to make sure that the vision is implemented.

#### Ensure Others Follow the Vision

You'll always be outnumbered by the rest of the company. This means that sometimes you have to push back and say no to others. If you don't you end

### Know the Market

You can't only know your audience anymore. You have to know the market to udnerstand what "pain points" your company is trying to solve. You also have to know the product and the users to be able to determine what to document, e.g. whether something is worth documenting at all. If you don't, you won't be able to pitch your vision.

### Ask Why

People tell tech writers what to do all the time. Tech writers rarely ask why. They should. If you don't, you can't prioritize, share your roadmap, and you won't have any time for strategic work. And you might end up fooling yourself.

### Perfection Takes Time

Create, ship, iterate. Apply the 80/20 rule.

### Be Proactive

It's easy not to be proactive. There are a lot of excuses: no time, no resources, management won't let you, people ignore you, that's not your job description, and so on. Designers faced this same problem. But they adapted and now they have more influence and budget and are involved early and intensely in projects.

### Treat Words as Tools

A programming language is a tool. Natural languages are also tools. The latter are deeply imperfect tools. Language is often insufficient to convey the required information. As with JavaScript, you can modify natural language. If you're too tied to style guides and best practices, you might be doing art.

### Share Knowledge

Instead of complaining about the poor writing of others, effective tech writers empower others to write and make changes. You can do this through blog posts, style guides, and one-on-one sessions.

## [Move Fast and Document Things: Strategies for Writing Internal Docs at Fast-Moving Organizations](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-ruthie-bendor)

Speaker: [Ruthie BenDor](https://twitter.com/unruthless)

Ruthie is an engineer, not a technical writer. She's worked at a lot of different organizations of all types. Most companies focus on external technical docs, the typical manuals you expect. But internal technical docs are important, too. They include: READMEs, wikis and other things like that. They are the materials you create for your colleagues and for your future self.

Ruthie told a story about working at a slow-moving non-profit. Before she left, she wrote tons of documentation about how everything works in the two months before her departure. That was the right approach for that organization because they wanted software to last as long as possible.

She then told another story about working at a digital agency, where she was creating prototypes, not production software, which was the goal of the agency. Ruthie didn't write much internal documentation there, only the minimum amount needed to get to "next Tuesday." Technical docs there weren't important because the software wasn't meant to last.

Ruthie then joined a startup where she assumed that technical docs would be important for, you know, shipping product. But that turned out to be a bad assumption. Most pojects had empty wiki pages and "why bother reading mes." At one point, she got into a Git mess that took two senior engineers over an hour to detangle.

### Four Simple Steps for Writing Internal Docs at Fast-Moving Orgs

At Ruthie's current company, new engineers can get code running in a couple of hours, usually before lunch on the first day.

1. Figure out what's broken.

    What wasn't broken in Ruthie's case  were the tools: they used CI, monitoring, and banned deploys after 4pm on Fridays. Co-workers were helpful and great. What was broken was the perception of internal technical docs: people thought their value depreciated too quickly to be worth it. Also, there was a presumption of homogenous technical backgrounds and shared institutional knowledge. There was also no unambiguous "right" way to write internal docs. Where the docs should live was not defined, so they were all over, in emails, post-its, photos of whiteboards, etc etc.

2. Figure out why your organization will care about fixing what's broken.

    The organization might not care about onboarding new staff. They might care about creating the product instead. The "bus factor" might not be enough to get an organization to care about internal technical docs because, if you could predict layoffs, you'd be writing your resume, not docs. Ruthie talked to engineers about what they were working on and found out that they cared about technical docs because they valued learning from each other. What and how you document things is a reflection of company culture.

3. Couch your solutions in the organization's value.

    "This is the fun part." You're trying to get the results you want with the materials you have--in other words, hacking in the best sense of the word. This is dependent on your organization's values and culture. The best way might be lunch and learn talks or it could be whitepapers. It just depends.  

4. At every inflection point, reevaluate, rinse, repeat.

    It's important to change things as your organization changes.

## [We're Not in Kansas Anymore: How to Find Courage while Following the Technical Doc Road](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-christy-lutz)

Speaker: [Christy Lutz](https://twitter.com/canncrochet)

When you're traveling down the technical doc road, your team (QA, support, etc) are your friends. You should talk to your friends--at standups, at other meetings.

Being a technical writer means being vulnerable because you need to potentially ask dumb questions in public. You might wear a lot of hats.

Make a plan. What is the goal of your career and/or projects. Create some kind of roadmap. Do research to support your plan. A lot of times, other people have already solved your problem. Research can also pose good questions to you about your docs. Even with a plan, though, you need to be flexible because, well, things change.

Share your work--with everyone. Read out loud to your dog (or cat). Get feedback from the person who scares you the most. Practice design critique: identify stakeholders and goals, then gather feedback. Expect positive feedback because "you don't write shit." But be prepared for negative feedback. You probably have imposter syndrome. That's ok. Everyone does. Believe in yourself and don't be brought down by your worst version of yourself. It's important to talk about adversity because nothing is perfect, not your draft, not the feedback, not your response to the feedback, nothing. "You were already brave" by being a technical writer "on the road."

## [CSAT- What's That?](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-betsy-roseberg)

Speaker: Betsy Roseberg

CSAT stands, here, for "customer satisfaction." Betsy works at New Relic. They have a comment box in their publicly available docs. They do get a lot of un-useful comments, like "**Was this document helpful?** No. **Comments:** no thamks. i am busy." Or: "**Comments:** More Pandas."

However, the majority of comments *are* useful. An example is that the command did not work and it caused errors. They reviewed the doc with an SME and udpated the command, which was out of date. For another one, a commenter requested documentation about a specific command. Or that a header should use underscores instead of dashes.

Reviewing the comments doesn't really take that much time, especially if you distribute the work among the team. New Relic rotates review duty to different writers each week. They get comments about much more than the docs, like the UI and UX of the product and the functionality of the doc site, which is just as important.

Yes/No data is also useful by signifying how useful the doc is. One page got all "No" votes and it turned out that the reason for that was an issue with the UI (it was missing the gear icon the docs said to click). It helps to prioritize your work. If a page has 950+ views and 6 "No" votes, that's something you should work on.

Next steps for New Relic include implementing OAuth data, following users as they look at the docs, and redesigning the site based on CSAT data.

## [Just in Time Documentation: Employing Agile Methodology to Create Living Documentation](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-brianne-hillmer)

Speaker: [Brianne Hillmer](https://twitter.com/writebriwrite)

Brianne works at Survey Gizmo as the "documentation coordinator." They had featurs guides, but the users didn't use them. Why not?

- They require familiarity with terminology
- Difficult to search
- Difficult to use
- Difficult to produce in time for release

Brianne decided to make the docs team work on Agile, "just-in-time" schedule. Fro docs, that means creating just enough documentation just in time. What ends up getting documented with this methodology? The overlap of a Venn diagram of:

- What the software can do (this is where survey gizmo started, but it doesn't cover workflows)
- What users wish to accomplish
- What users can't figure out

Brianne looked at the following sources of information to figure out what users couldn't figure out:

- Support tickets.

    She set up a process with support for figuring out whether the responses they were providing were generalizable. They use ZenDesk with a Zapier integration that writes to a Google Sheet: the support engineer only needs to check a checkbox. This resulted in documents that responded to the tickets' concerns: How do I? guides, changes to the UI, workarounds, and FAQs. It's important to monitor traffic after writing the docs: remove low-traffic docs, "gussy-up" high traffic docs. You also need to let customers know that you're doing this, through "new" labels and recently updated boxes. Continue getting and responding to feedback. Articles can be short and minimal.

Things that Brianne learned:

- It's OK to have a lot of content
- Docs can be updated just in time
- Document workarounds
- **Documentation is its own product**

To start documenting things "just in time":

- Create a systematic process
- Document it fast
- Be a champion
- Let go. These quick articles don't have to be perfect.
